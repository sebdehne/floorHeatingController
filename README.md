Heater controller
===============

Assembly code which I use for a heating controller, developed for PIC16F690 microcontroller.
The SHT15 sensor is used for temperature and humidity. RF receive and transmit modules are used for
two way communication to the controller.

See https://github.com/sebdehne/pic8libs for all libs.
